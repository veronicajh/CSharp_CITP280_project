# CSharp_CITP280_project
This application was designed for a class project. It is a preschool & learning game. There is an interface to be used in classes to set the border color of the game and a base class for a child's game program where inheritance is used. PreschoolGame is the base class for FriendsGame, SequenceGame, and PlaySafeGame classes. Polymorphism is used through the abstract method (to be overridden in child classes). Exception handling is used in Games.cs, a file is used in Games.cs, LINQ is used in FriendsGame.cs, a programmer-created extension method is the GameExtension class, a database is used in FriendsGame and PlaySafeGame classes, and threading is used in both SequenceGame.cs and Games.cs. A programmer-created Generic class is the BackgroundOptions class, a generic list is used in the FriendsGame and PlaySafeGame classes, and a delegate is used in GameOptions.cs to wire BackgroundEvent to the event handler. A programmer-created event is BackgroundEvent (BackgroundOptions.cs has the subscriber method) and a static Constructor is used in the TrainTheme, CarTheme, OceanTheme, and AnimalTheme classes.
